                    of people that share a love for Irish music.

                    Here at The Trad Academy, we adore Irish Music, plain and simple. Ireland, Irish history, and Irish people all hold a special place in our hearts. 
                    However, connecting through music and the music itself is really what it's all about.

                    The entirety of Irish culture is incredibly distinctive, intricate, and of course fascinating! Even though Irish heritage, traditions, and society have 
                    many different facets, music plays a significant role in all of them. On an island without electricity and with a tiny minority of literate citizens in 
                    ages past, the only forms of entertainment were music and storytelling.

                    Villages would swarm into their local tavern on chilly, gloomy nights to share a warm fire, hear tales, and take in the music performed by the neighborhood 
                    musicians. As music is still a huge part of living in Ireland, it started a tradition that has been continued ever since.

                    You may be asking yourself, why learn trad? Music is a way of connecting with people and is something that anyone can enjoy. It's an international
                    language. How many times have you seen a video of an amazing musician and thought to yourself, I wish I could do that. Well, you can!
                </P>
                <p>
                    Trad music is something we believe all people should experience. It brings people together, tells stories and most importantly, you'll have great craic!
                    Playing together with other musicians and immersing yourself in our rich Irish culture is what trad music is all about.

            It's the heart and that's so important in the music. There's a tendency for people to think that they have to be the best technicians and the best at learning 
            all the tunes, but actually it's to do with who you are and not what you play.

                Be yourself when playing. Don't try to copy anyone or you'll never really be at ease playing. Just develop your own style naturally.
