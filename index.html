                            The Trad Academy is a midlands based music academy. We specialise in the teachings of
                            traditional Irish music and strive to connect all types
                            of people that share a love for Irish music.

                            Here at The Trad Academy, we adore Irish Music, plain and simple. Ireland, Irish history,
                            and Irish people all hold a special place in our hearts.
                            However, connecting through music and the music itself is really what it's all about.

                            The entirety of Irish culture is incredibly distinctive, intricate, and of course
                            fascinating! Even though Irish heritage, traditions, and society have
                            many different facets, music plays a significant role in all of them. On an island without
                            electricity and with a tiny minority of literate citizens in
                            ages past, the only forms of entertainment were music and storytelling.
                        </P>

                            Villages would swarm into their local tavern on chilly, gloomy nights to share a warm fire,
                            hear tales, and take in the music performed by the neighborhood
                            musicians. As music is still a huge part of living in Ireland, it started a tradition that
                            has been continued ever since.

                            You may be asking yourself, why learn trad? Music is a way of connecting with people and is
                            something that anyone can enjoy. It's an international
                            language. How many times have you seen a video of an amazing musician and thought to
                            yourself, I wish I could do that. Well, you can!
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            Trad music is something we believe all people should experience. It brings people together,
                            tells stories and most importantly, you'll have great craic!
                            Playing together with other musicians and immersing yourself in our rich Irish culture is
                            what trad music is all about.

                It's the heart and that's so important in the music. There's a tendency for people to think that they
                have to be the best technicians and the best at learning
                all the tunes, but actually it's to do with who you are and not what you play.

                Be yourself when playing. Don't try to copy anyone or you'll never really be at ease playing. Just
