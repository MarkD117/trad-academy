                    The Trad Academy is a midlands based music academy. We specialise in the teachings of traditional Irish music and strive to connect all types 
                    of people that share a love for Irish music. 
                </P>
                <p>
                    Here at The Trad Academy, we adore Irish Music, plain and simple. Ireland, Irish history, and Irish people all hold a special place in our hearts. 
                    However, connecting through music and the music itself is really what it's all about.

                    The entirety of Irish culture is incredibly distinctive, intricate, and of course fascinating! Even though Irish heritage, traditions, and society have 
                    many different facets, music plays a significant role in all of them. On an island without electricity and with a tiny minority of literate citizens in 
                    ages past, the only forms of entertainment were music and storytelling.

                    Villages would swarm into their local tavern on chilly, gloomy nights to share a warm fire, hear tales, and take in the music performed by the neighborhood 
                    musicians. As music is still a huge part of living in Ireland, it started a tradition that has been continued ever since.
