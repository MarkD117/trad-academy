# Trad Academy
Trad Academy is an online resource for a midlands music academy. It is targeted at individuals of all ages and backgrounds who have a keen interest in traditional Irish music. Trad Academy gives it's users an insight into what trad music is all about, tells them about the history, and even shows examples of material. The main purpose is to entice users to sign up for musical lesson programs that are provided by expert tutors from the academy.

The live project can be accessed [here](https://markd117.github.io/trad-academy/)

## UI/UX 

### Design Overview
For the design of the site, I wanted to go with something that was easy on eyes and simplistic to understand but gives the user all the information they could need. I first hand sketched a prototype of what I initially wanted the site to look like. As I wanted to write decent amount of information, I knew I needed to make a multi-page site. The home page is aimed at anyone who wants to learn a bit more about the company as well as some information about trad music. 

If the user likes what they see, they can delve into the lessons page to learn about traditional Irish instruments in more detail and they can also hear them being played. Both of these pages are structured in a way that allows the user to see what they are reading about with an image, and get more context through the content beside it. The sessions page is aimed at people who are looking for a way of connecting with others through music. the structure of the sessions page is a simple layout of four flip cards which allow the user easy access to finding out where and when sessions take place. 

Finally, the sign up page presents the user with a minimal amount of detail that has to be entered to contact the Trad Academy. The sessions page is structured in a way that allows the user to have quick access to all the information about sessions. Minimal clicks and immediate access is something that I wanted to implement as people can get frustrated if there is too many clicks or too much information to read. This is the same for the sign up page. The user has to enter very minimal information which allows them to have a good user experience.

### Colour Scheme
Due to the nature of most musical instruments being simple in colour, I wanted to replicate this idea with the colour scheme of the website. A warm platinum colour is used for the main body of the site. A jet grey and off-white were used as an alternation of text and background colours which contrasted well against each other. The off-white backgrounds also provide a subtle contrast between content and the platinum body colour. Finally, I used accents of a deep yellow that can be seen in the Trad Academy logo.

- `#E8E8E8` used for body base.
- `#3A3A3A` used for main text & background.
- `#FAFAFA` used for heading texts & backgroud.
- `#EBB42C` used for accents & highlights.

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/103a55-ffffff-934106-f6ebe0-255c7e-fd9c35) was used to generate this image of the colour pallet below.

### Fonts & Icons
Three separate text fonts were used for the site. All fonts were sourced from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Tenor Sans was used for all headings (Used as it is a rich looking academic font that fits well with the theme of a music academy.)
- Raleway was used for all other text elements (Again, another rich looking academic font that contrasts well with the headings.)
- Open Sans was used for the home page quotes (This font was used to differenciate the quotes from the main body of the site.)
- All icons were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## Wireframes
During the planning stages, I  created wireframes for all pages of the site. I first did a rough sketch of my initial layout idea and then used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design the digital wireframes. All wireframes can be seen below.
