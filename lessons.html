                        <p>
                            In traditional Irish music, the Irish Tenor Banjo originally gained popularity in the 1920s.
                            From the American dance hall scene, where it was mostly
                            utilized as an accompaniment instrument, it made its way to Ireland. Similar to a guitar,
                            players would strum and play chords on the instrument. Irish
                            musicians soon started to modify its use to play traditional song melodies instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, the Irish tenor banjo is a staple of any good session and a crucial component of any
                            c√©ili band formation. The banjo is for those who are looking
                            to pack a punch with their playing and be heard far and wide. With the help of our excellent
                            tutors, you can achieve that! Have a listen to one of our tutors, belt out a tune on the
                            banjo!

                        <p>
                            The mandolin dates back to the Middle Ages and is the ancestor of the lute. The Neapolitan
                            or Italian style bowl-back mandolin, the arch-top mandolin, and the flat-back mandolin are
                            the three main varieties of mandolins played today. The flat back variant is most frequently
                            used in traditional Irish music, and it is frequently referred to as the "Irish mandolin".
                            Over the years, mandolins have gained considerable popularity amongst Irish traditional
                            performers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One factor in their appeal, in addition to their bright tone and small stature, is the
                            simplicity with which Irish fiddle and banjo players may switch from one to the other due to
                            their similar left-hand fingering. The mandolin is for those who are looking for a sweet
                            sounding instrument that synergizes well when playing with others. Have a listen to tune
                            played by another one of our amazing tutors that displays the qulities of the mandolin!

                        <p>
                            One of the most widely used instruments in contemporary traditional Irish music is the violin, or
                            fiddle as it is also known. Fiddles have existed since the Middle Ages, although, the modern fiddle
                            did not become popular in traditional Irish music until the 17th century. The violin and the fiddle
                            are the exact same instrument; however, some will argue that while a violin is a fiddle, not every
                            fiddle is a violin. So what's the difference?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The difference is the style in which they are played. If it's is being used for classical, it is 
                            generally called a violin, when used for trad music, it's referred to as a fiddle. In trad music, 
                            a variety of ornamentation is used such as cuts, rolls and triplets. This style of playing is what 
                            gives it the name of the Irish fiddle. Want to know what these types of ornamentation are? Material
                            like this will be taught by our brilliant tutors. Have a listen to one of our tutors display the 
                            true capabilities of the fiddle!
